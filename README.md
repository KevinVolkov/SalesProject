Kevin's comment for this commit: 
11/07.24 Mason I restored my branch, which you deleted. The code was the same as in your branch, but with a full directory structure, not a single zip file. 
If you delete my branch again, I will stop working with you, restore my original branch (with my original code, which I sacrificed just to have a common code
for everybody as it is supposed to be), because it is impossible to work with the chaotic way you do things, like deleting messages and branches if you do not
like them. Again: you do not have the right to delete  branches in GitHub and messages in Jira.

11/05/24 This is supposed to maintained the same as Kevin and Mason branch but with full directory
structure as it supposed to be on GitHub
